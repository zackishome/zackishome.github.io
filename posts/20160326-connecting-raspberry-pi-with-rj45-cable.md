# connecting raspberry pi with rj45 cable

We could use the laptop with rj45 port to connect to raspberry pi. No router or switch is required only 1 rj45 cable is needed to directly connect the pi and laptop. Besides, we need to install dhcp server software and nmap tool on the laptop running ubuntu.
